YAUIX - Yet Another UI eXtension
================================

This add-on is my simple attempt to extend the UI of the Classic edition of
World of Warcraft. I've found myself often installing multiple add-ons, while
only using a small part of their functionality, so I've decided to write my
own interface extension add-on with only the functionality that I actually need.

Features
--------

- Show the amount and percentage (when applicable) of the target's health and
  resource bars.
- Show the level, difficulty, and group modifiers of quests in the quest
  tracker, and increase the font size of it slightly.
- Show the sell price and item level in item tooltips.
- Show the creature family of creatures where applicable.

Known Bugs
----------

- Hunter pets should be considered pseudo-player characters, and as such, their
  health should not be shown, only the percentage of it.

Planned Features
----------------

- Show the player's coordinates in a frame under the mini-map.
- Show unit and item IDs in their respective tooltips.
- Show the experience rewarded by quests in the Quest Log.
