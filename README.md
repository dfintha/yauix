# YAUIX - Yet Another UI eXtension

This add-on is my simple attempt to extend the UI of the Classic edition of
World of Warcraft. I've found myself often installing multiple add-ons, while
only using a small part of their functionality, so I've decided to write my
own interface extension add-on with only the functionality that I actually need.

## Features

- Display a text showing how many more kills of a unit are needed upon killing
  to level up if the player has not reached maximum level. This takes rested XP
  into consideration.
- Show the amount (when applicable) and percentage on health and resource bars
  for the player, their pet, and party members.
- Show the level, difficulty, and group modifiers of quests in the quest
  tracker, and increase the font size of it slightly.
- Show the sell price and item level in item tooltips for non-recipe items when
  the player is not interacting with a vendor.
- Show the creature family of creatures where applicable.
- Show the IDs of units and items where applicable.
- Show the experience reward of quests in the Quest Log.
- Show the player's current coordinates in the bottom right corner of the
  screen.
- Enhance the experience and reputation bars with more sensible, always present
  information strings.
- Show unit classification for special units in their nameplates.
