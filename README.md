# YAUIX - Yet Another UI eXtension

This add-on is my simple attempt to extend the UI of the Classic edition of
World of Warcraft. I've found myself often installing multiple add-ons, while
only using a small part of their functionality, so I've decided to write my
own interface extension add-on with only the functionality that I actually need.

## Features

- Show the amount and percentage (when applicable) of the player's and
  target's health and resource bars.
- Show the level, difficulty, and group modifiers of quests in the quest
  tracker, and increase the font size of it slightly.
- Show the sell price and item level in item tooltips.
- Show the creature family of creatures where applicable.
- Show the IDs of units and items where applicable.

## License

The add-on is under WTFPL. For more information, see the LICENSE file.
